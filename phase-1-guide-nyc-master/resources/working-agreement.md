# Working Agreement

See [DBC Policies](../../../../student-handbook/rules-and-policies.md) for the complete set of DBC policies.

### Core Hours Overview
- You will meet with your accountability buddies 15 minutes before the start of core hours every week day; text or call your buddies if they are not present or if you are running late.

- You are expected to be onsite and ready to work during core hours.  If you have extenuating circumstances, let your instructors know as soon as possible.  During lunch you are free; however, there may be days when you are asked to be onsite during lunch (e.g., for assessment review).

- At the beginning of core hours and right after lunch we will meet in the open area near the Phase 1 work stations for announcements.

### Phase 1 Priorities
- Learning how to appropriately respond versus react… to error messages, challenges, and self talk.
- Learning how to communicate what you're feeling, thinking, and needing.
- Learning how to build and use mental models.
- Helping each other to grow both as individuals and as a tribe.
