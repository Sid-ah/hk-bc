# AJAXify Sinatra

## Learning Competencies

* Use AJAX actions to change views based on asynchronous data 
* Implement synchronous / asynchronous requests in a web application
* Enter into an existing code base and extend it

## Summary

We're going to take one of our previous Sinatra apps and **AJAXify** it to practice making AJAX calls.

## Releases

### Release 0: Choose your app

Choose one of the following applications (preferably one you have a basic MVP created):

1. Craigslist JR 
2. Blog (Anonymous or Multi-User) 
3. Url Shortner 

### Release 1: AJAXify it!

Take a link or button of your choice and AJAX that action. After you've completed this, commit your code!

### Release 2: AJAXify it MORE!

Take the submission of a form (think: creation of a new user or a blog post) and AJAX the submission of the data. Commit immediately following completing.

### Release 3: Refactor and Stretch

You can go as far as you would like with this challenge. The intent is to practice with AJAX.
