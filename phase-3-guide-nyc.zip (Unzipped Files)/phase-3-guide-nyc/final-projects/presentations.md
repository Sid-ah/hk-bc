# Presentations

It's time to show off what you've made to the community. Here are some tips on putting together an effective presentation of your final project at DBC.

Before presentation day, you should be able to do a complete runthrough in eight minutes without stopping. To get there, expect a minimum of five complete runthroughs with the full team.

You have __ten minutes__ to present and roughly __four minutes__ for questions.

## Why we present...

- To tell a story of group process, technical proficiency and problem solving under pressure that illustrates the skills an employer can expect of any Dev Bootcamp graduate.
- To show off the individual passions and interests that make for a good match with employers.
- To celebrate the progress you've made in your understanding of creating software applications.
- To inspire our fellow boots to reach farther than they ever thought they could.
- To get practice talking about software in front of people.

## Presentation Breakdown

- 30s:  Hello + Value Proposition
- 30s:  Teaser
- 1m:   Team member intros
- 5m:   The Story
- 3m:   The App
- 4m:   Questions

## Hello

Hello and one sentence value proposition.

__Goal:__ Tell them what problem you solve.

__Goal:__ Make the project memorable enough to talk about.

_Example: "Hi folks, we're OtterSauce, we make it possible to send a digital otter anywhere in the world. Here's our site..."_

## Teaser

Show the best page. Or two.

__Goal:__ Show just enough UI to make the audience interested in hearing about it.

__Goal:__ Show, don't tell.

_Example: "We're going to see more of that in a minute. But first let me introduce our team"_

## Intros

Introduce your teammates.

__Goal:__ Identify interests of individuals on the team: "I love UI...", "He's a hardass about testing..", "She loves solving problems like..." Provide hooks to start conversations.

## Story

Tell a story about how you got to the product you shipped. Some example stories...

_"We explored lots of different products that addressed this but ultimately decided that no one was doing this..." (product story)_

_"We did this one thing, and the implementation was really interesting. This is why..." (technology story)_

_"Some of our early projects got really gnarly, so when we started, we really wanted our testing and source control to be rock solid..." (process story)_

This story should have basic story arc:

- a challenge ("we really want to build this thing...")
- a conflict ("math is hard!")
- a conclusion ("so this is what we got out of it")

Mandatory keyword dropping - this might come up naturally in your story, but if not, you should include a one to three sentence namecheck.

- __The keyword-level technology stack:__ _"This is a Rails app using a mapping framework called Mapstr and some custom JS. It's hosted at Heroku, with location data on MapBox. The base map is from Open Street Map."_
- __The group methodology:__ _"We used TDD with Cucumber; We had hourly standups and morning scrums...."_

Keep your stack description keyword only - the goal is the start the next conversation, not explain everything.

Use full screen images to help pace this section and remind you of order. Speak to an image, then hand off to a new speaker. We do not recommend lists, bullets, or powerpoint fluff. Repeat: avoid words on slides. Think 3 - 6 images per 5 minutes of talk. Images can be of prototypes, action shots (ie typing), whiteboards, etc.

Getting into code examples is uncommon but likely to impress some. Be mindful of time; planning and practice helps with this. If you want to focus on interaction or code examples, shorten the story to spend more time on the app portion.

## The App

Know what you want to show, and show only that. Be quick. Be incomplete. Seed your app with enough data. Pre-load views in separate browser tabs so that you can quickly move through them. If people want more, they can ask questions.

## Questions

This is where DBC students shine. Get through the demo in order to preserve your question time. Going to questions early is totally OK. Here is a [list of potential questions](https://gist.github.com/edshadi/0c04ded0c6fe8eda3adb).

__Timing enforcement:__ A helper will post your time on a whiteboard at 8m, 9m, 10m... until you get to questions. Make the transition to questions explicit.

Example: "That's our presentation, and we're happy to answer questions" [applause]

Once in questions, staff will call for "last question" etc to facilitate exit from the stage and keep you on time. Don't verbalize "We're out of time", just say thank you and end the presentation.
