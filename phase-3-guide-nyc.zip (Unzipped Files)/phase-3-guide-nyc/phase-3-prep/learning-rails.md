# Learning Rails

Rails is known for having a lot of conventions and magic, but under the hood, it is really nothing special.  In fact, the core parts of building a website in Rails are very similar to Sinatra - it is the Rails convention and magic that throws people off.  Therefore, we will break up our learning of Rails into steps:

1. [Rails the Sinatra Way](./rails-the-sinatra-way.md)

    This guide will take you through building a Rails app as you have been building your Sinatra apps.  The goal is that you will see how similar Rails is to Sinatra, and that you can always fallback to your Sinatra understanding if things get confusing.

2. [Rails the Rails Way](./rails-the-rails-way.md)

    This guide will take you through the Rails way of doing things and the common conventions you would expect to see in a Rails app.  It is important to remember that most of this is just convention.  There are also a lot of helpers and convenience methods built-in to help make the common tasks of web development easier.

    For now, we will NOT use generators, or the `rails generate` command. These are great time savers, but they won't help you learn the different components of the Rails stack.
