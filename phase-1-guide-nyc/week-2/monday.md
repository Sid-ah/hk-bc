### Introduction to OOP

### Core

**Daily retros**

- How do you decide what to make into an object?
- At any point today did you feel defensive or frustrated? What made you feel that way and things that you could do to prevent that feeling from taking over?

**Challenges**

- [Ruby Drill: Accessor Methods](../../../../tree/master/ruby-drill-accessor-methods-challenge)
- [Design Drill: Public vs. Private Interfaces](../../../../tree/master/design-drill-public-vs-private-interfaces-challenge)
- [Ruby Drill: The self Keyword](../../../../tree/master/ruby-drill-the-self-keyword-challenge)
- [Ruby Drill: Exploring Scope](../../../../tree/master/ruby-drill-exploring-scope-challenge)
- [Orange Tree 1: Just Oranges](../../../../tree/master/orange-tree-1-just-oranges-challenge)
- [Orange Tree 2: Groves](../../../../tree/master/orange-tree-2-groves-challenge)
- [Design Drill: Argument-Order Dependency](../../../../tree/master/design-drill-argument-order-dependency-challenge)
- [Ruby Drill: ARGV Basics](../../../../tree/master/ruby-drill-argv-basics-challenge)

**Prep for Tomorrow**

- Daily retros
  - How do you decide when to use inheritance vs module? Why would you use one over the other?
  - What are indicators that signal that you should continue working or ask for help?
  - Do you and your partner spend too much time on certain problems? How can you mitigate this?
- Practicing POODR - read POODR throughout the week. For each chapter, apply the concept to your personal "OBJECT" in code.
